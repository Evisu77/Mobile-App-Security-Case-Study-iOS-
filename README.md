# Mobile App Security Case Study (iOS) ‚Äì Responsible Disclosure Practice

This case study documents a limited, passive security review of a publicly available iOS application. The assessment was conducted independently for learning purposes, with a strict focus on ethical boundaries and responsible disclosure.

## Summary

The goal of this review was to analyze how mobile apps handle user data, authentication, and third-party integrations. Testing stopped before any unauthorized access or active exploitation. A responsible disclosure report was submitted to the app vendor.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No vulnerabilities were exploited. No private data was accessed. All research was passive and legal.

## Key Findings

- **No user authentication required**, even for sensitive actions.
- **Permissive network configuration**, disabling iOS HTTPS protections.
- **Third-party SDKs transmitting behavioral data** without visible user consent.
- **Unnecessary microphone access** requested by the app.
- **Indexed usage data by Siri & Search**, without transparency to users.

## üõ†Techniques Used

- IPA unpacking and static analysis (`Info.plist`)
- Passive traffic inspection via Burp Suite and Wireshark
- iOS privacy behavior observation
- No reverse engineering or active probing

## What I Learned

- Mobile app security principles (authentication, ATS, permission handling)
- Data privacy best practices and SDK behavior
- How to write a responsible disclosure report professionally
- Real-world reporting ethics ‚Äî and when to stop testing
